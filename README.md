This project is a Java-based networking chat application that leverages the power of **IPv6 addresses** to establish real-time communication between users. The backend is implemented using Java sockets, enabling direct, efficient, and reliable peer-to-peer messaging. The application is designed to support modern networking standards, ensuring compatibility with IPv6 infrastructure for enhanced scalability and global connectivity.

Key features include:  
- **IPv6-Based Communication:** All connections are established using IPv6 addresses, ensuring better address space and advanced networking capabilities.  
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Supports bi-directional real-time chat between users with low latency.  
- **User Management:** Tracks connected users and facilitates seamless message delivery.  
- **Custom Protocols:** Implements custom socket communication protocols for message exchange and error handling.  

This project demonstrates the potential of modern networking using IPv6 and serves as a foundation for scalable, next-generation communication systems.
